# Housing Data Engineering Pipeline 

## Main Repository 

## Modelling Housing Prices 

We attempt to model housing prices for the following:

1. [Monthly median resale flat prices](modelling/sarima.ipynb)
2. Monthly median private property prices 
3. Monthly median flat rental prices
4. Monthly median private property rental prices

- Before integrating extract and transform processes into the pipeline, a full process from data extraction to modelling was carried out.
- This was done to ensure that the pipeline would be able to handle the data and produce the desired results
- An example process is outlined in the [notebook](modelling/sarima.ipynb) where resale flat prices are modelled.
